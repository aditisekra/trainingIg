      India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic
      variety and rich cultural heritage. It has achieved all-round
      socio-economic progress during the last 65 years of its Independence.
      India has become self-sufficient in agricultural production and is now one
      of the top industrialized countries in the world and one of the few
      nations to have gone into outer space to conquer nature for the benefit of
      the people. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the
      snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south.
      As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest
      of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the
      country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in
      the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off
      into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the
      Arabian Sea on the west. As you travel, India offers a range of vast
      tourism choices, diverse in land and nature, people, tribes, cuisine,
      faiths, dance forms, music, arts, crafts, adventure, sport, spirituality,
      history; even these vary as you journey from one state to another. As a
      country, India has achieved all-round socio-economic progress in the last
      70 years of independence. The change is clearly visible in the Tier I and
      Tier II cities. However, the fascinating aspect lies in the stark
      difference as you travel through the new and old parts of its cities. From
      world-class airports and hotels, luxurious shopping malls, restaurants,
      pubs and cafes to overcrowded streets and alleyways, in the same cities,
      filled with thousands of little shops offering every possible modern and
      ethnic product and native street food is a fascinating experience.

      In ancient times, people from all over the world were keen to come to
      India. ThePersians followed by the Iranians and Parsis immigrated to
      India. Then came theMoghuls and they too settled down permanently in
      India. Chengis Khan, the Mongolian, invaded and looted India many times.
      Alexander the Great too, came to conquer India but went back after a
      battle with Porus. He-en Tsang from China came in pursuit of knowledge and
      to visit the ancient Indian universities of Nalanda and Takshila. Columbus
      wanted to come to India, but instead landed on the shores of America.
      Vasco da Gama from Portugal came to trade his country's goods in return
      for Indian spices. The French came and established their colonies in
      India. Lastly, the Britishers came and ruled over India for nearly 200
      years. After the battle of Plassey in 1757, the British achieved political
      power in India. And their paramountcy was established during the tenure of
      Lord Dalhousie, who became the Governor- General in 1848. He annexed
      Punjab, Peshawar and the Pathan tribes inthe north-west of India. And by
      1856, the British conquest and its authority were firmly established. And
      while the British power gained its heights during the middle of the 19th
      century, the discontent of the local rulers, the peasantry, the
      intellectuals, common masses as also of the soldiers who became unemployed
      due to the disbanding of the armies of various states that were annexed by
      the British, became widespread. This soon broke out into a revolt which
      assumed the dimensions of the 1857 Mutiny.
